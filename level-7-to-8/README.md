# Bandit Level 7 → Level 8

**Goal:** The password is in the file `data.txt` on the line that contains the word "millionth".

### 🧰 Commands used

```bash
# 'grep' searches the file for the word "millionth"
grep "millionth" data.txt
# -> PASSWORD_REDACTED


💡 What I learned
How to use the grep command to search for specific text inside a file.

This is much faster than reading the whole file manually.
